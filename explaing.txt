یک پروژه دارم که بخش اولش رو برات میفرستم. باید بهم کامل و مفهومی توضیحش بدی و بعد من بخش دوم رو میفرستم

 Introduction
 The project aims to implement sequential decision-making strategies for investment. Assume
 you’re working in the Finance Department of a company. Your current task is to optimize
 investment decisions over time using predictive models and optimization techniques. There
 are three distinct opportunities to invest your capital: Gold, Cryptocurrencies (Bit
coin and Ethereum), and Government Bonds. Each option has unique constraints as
 described below.
 Investment decisions are made on a weekly basis. At the beginning of every new week,
 your available capital reflects the gains or losses from the previous week’s choices. Your
 objective is to define the strategy, constraints, and variables to maximize the overall
 revenue, using linear models and optimization tools.
 Investment Options
 Gold
 • Revenue is influenced by global financial indicators.
 • You can only buy/sell gold in whole number percentages of its price.
 Cryptocurrencies (BTC and ETH)
 • Revenue depends on highly volatile market conditions.
 • You can buy(long)/sell(short) in any fractional amount of market prices.
 • In addition to spot trading, margin trading is available with leverage 1 to 3.
 1
• Margin trades must be closed within one month, and losses/gains are amplified ac
cordingly.
 • You may define TP (Take Profit) or SL (Stop Loss) levels. If these are triggered
 during the week, a part of the position can be automatically closed before the week’s
 end.
 Bonds
 • The revenue is fixed to 0.55% per month.
 • Once bought, the capital is locked for one month.
 • Investments can be fractional.

Spot and Margin Trading
 In cryptocurrency markets, two common types of trading are spot trading and margin
 trading.
 Spot Trading
 Spot trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery at the
 current market price. Once a spot trade is executed, ownership of the asset is transferred
 instantly between buyer and seller. This is the most straightforward type of trading, without
 any borrowing or leverage.
 Margin Trading
 Margin trading allows traders to borrow funds from an exchange to increase the size of their
 trading positions. This enables them to trade with more capital than they actually hold,
 amplifying both profits and losses. In contrast to futures trading, margin positions don’t
 have a fixed expiration date — the position can be held as long as the trader maintains
 the required margin and pays any associated interest fees. Traders can open either a long
 position, where they profit from a price increase, or a short position, where they profit
 from a price decrease by selling borrowed assets and buying them back at a lower price.
 • Leverage: Crypto exchanges typically allow leverage up to 10x on margin trades. For
 example, with 10x leverage, a trader with $1,000 can open a position worth $10,000.
 • Amplified Risk: A 10% price move results in a 100% gain or loss on a 10x leveraged
 position. Higher leverage increases both profit potential and risk of liquidation.

• Holding Duration: Margin positions don’t expire. Traders may hold them for as
 long as they maintain sufficient margin and pay the interest fees on the borrowed funds.
 • TP/SL Levels: Traders can set Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) thresholds
 to automatically close a trade when specific price levels are reached.
 • Margin Calls and Liquidation: If the trader’s equity falls below the maintenance
 margin level due to market movement, the exchange issues a margin call. If no addi
tional collateral is provided, the position is liquidated to prevent further loss.
 Implementation Guidelines
 Your goal is to maximize the final wealth through a combination of forecasting and
 optimization. The investment simulation begins on April 1, 2024, with an initial capital
 of $50,000. Throughout the simulation, track weekly investment decisions and outcomes,
 monitor asset price fluctuations, and calculate the portfolio value over time. At the end
 of the simulation period, the final return on investment should be computed based on the
 overall performance of the chosen strategies.
 • Forecasting: Predict weekly prices using linear regression models applied to his
torical data (only the close price is required).
 • DataPreprocessing: For guidance on handling time series data, refer to this tutorial.
 It provides useful insights into data preparation. Although you must implement the
 linear model yourself, you may utilize Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas,
 matplotlib and etc for data processing and visualization.
 • Modeling Tools: Use MiniZinc for formulating your linear regression and decision
making models. You may connect Python with MiniZinc using the MiniZinc Python
 library. Your implementation should include a model file (.mzn) and a data file (.dzn).
 Final Report
 While and after implementing the project, a full academic report should be written, contain
ing documentation for the strategies used and the code implemented. This report should de
tail the steps taken throughout the process, including forecasting, optimization, and decision
making strategies and an analysis of your results. You can use any statistical measurements
 for your runtime and performance. It’s also recommended to add charts to illustrate your
 decision throughout the time.
